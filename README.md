# Utility Pole Survey Image Classifier

## TL;DR
This project implements a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to classify utility pole survey images. An overall accuracy of over 96% was achieved on a real-world test dataset. I worked on this project driven by my own interest and on my own time.

## Report
### Problem Overview and Definition
Data collection and analysis of utility poles is common in the world of Outside Plant (OSP) design. The most efficient OSP engineering companies survey utility poles by photographing them and later employ various processing techniques to extract useful data. Often the first step in this process is to group images by type, which is usually done manually and can be time intensive.

This project aims to develop a model that will classify a survey image into one of six possible classes. An image of each class can be seen in Figure 1.
